# Applying Machine Learning for the Development of Physical Sensor Models in Game Engine Environment

Contributors: Daniel Huang, Felix Meng, and Jason Zhu

## Introduction

This project aims to generate a model which can calculate distortion effects efficiently and accurately given distortion parameters and an undistorted image.

## Dataset and Data Pipeline


TODO: Complete list of dataset pipeline items
- [ ] Gather a dataset of undistorted images
- [ ] Create distortion pipeline to generate distorted labels
- [ ] Package data into format to be used by models

## Models

TODO: Complete list of models to be used.
- [ ] GAN?
- [ ] Simple feed forward model?
- [ ] Traditional distortion algorithms (e.g. OpenCV) as baseline?
